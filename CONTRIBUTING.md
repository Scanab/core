## Contributing to Jeedom

Contributions, whether on the Core or on the Documentation, are always welcome, and we do our best to process them quickly. A fault on the documentation, a passage that could be clearer, a bug on the Core ? The contributions are there for that.

There is lot of stuff to do, and even not being a developper, you can help!

[Read here](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/contribute/) for more informations about contributing to Core developement or Documentation.
